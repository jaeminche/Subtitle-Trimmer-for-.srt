1
00:00:15,283 --> 00:00:18,157
(Prince Milpoong, Lee Tan)

2
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:19,411
This feels...

3
00:00:21,425 --> 00:00:23,999
a bit strange.

4
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:26,636
This feels...

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,238
Go and find out.

6
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:34,945
Why isn't anyone coming?

7
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:36,115
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

8
00:00:47,956 --> 00:00:49,013
Prince Milpoong.

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,158
Yoon Yeong.

10
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:00,441
Yoon Yeong.

11
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:05,709
Yoon Yeong.

12
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,317
Where were you?

13
00:01:11,323 --> 00:01:14,058
I thought you left me.

14
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:15,938
I guess I was wrong.

15
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:19,248
Right? You came back, right?

16
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:22,336
Don't worry.

17
00:01:22,592 --> 00:01:24,425
Our reinforcements will gather here.

18
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:26,831
There are no reinforcements.
This is a trap.

19
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,599
Lee Yin Jwa deserted you.

20
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:35,187
No.

21
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:36,811
No.

22
00:01:38,113 --> 00:01:39,939
- That's not true, Yoon Yeong.
- We must go.

23
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:42,736
The royal forces are coming.

24
00:01:43,347 --> 00:01:45,561
If you stay here, you will die.

25
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:51,742
Capture Prince Milpoong alive!

26
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:52,831
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

27
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:58,045
This is useless. It is over now.
If you want to live,

28
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:01,081
you should run away with me.

29
00:02:15,038 --> 00:02:19,025
His Majesty has arrived.

30
00:02:28,092 --> 00:02:29,415
(King Yeongjo)

31
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:30,723
I finally meet you.

32
00:02:31,394 --> 00:02:32,507
Leader of the rebels.

33
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:34,757
Lee Yin Jwa.

34
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,492
(Lee Yin Jwa, Namin)

35
00:02:37,494 --> 00:02:41,248
How dare you harm
the innocent people...

36
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,767
and dishonor this country?

37
00:02:45,003 --> 00:02:46,159
I will ensure...

38
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,594
to deal with your horrible crime...

39
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:51,334
with the death penalty.

40
00:02:52,777 --> 00:02:54,120
You are an unworthy king.

41
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:58,283
- How dare you?
- Finally,

42
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:01,657
I meet you too.

43
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:03,192
How dare you speak that way?

44
00:03:05,573 --> 00:03:06,629
How dare I?

45
00:03:07,902 --> 00:03:09,148
Who is this man?

46
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:13,704
How is he different from me?

47
00:03:15,605 --> 00:03:17,085
The only thing I am guilty of...

48
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:19,744
is that I was born a Namin.

49
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:23,285
That is all.

50
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,469
Shut your mouth!

51
00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:30,260
Just behead me.

52
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,557
I will die anyway.

53
00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:34,701
I might as well die here.

54
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:36,137
However,

55
00:03:37,089 --> 00:03:39,519
I raised an army for a good reason.

56
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,652
Just because you're a Namin,
you can't do anything in this world!

57
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:46,931
All I tried to do was to change...

58
00:03:49,956 --> 00:03:51,699
the rotten world I'm living in.

59
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,603
Your Majesty, please give me
your orders.

60
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:55,095
- I shall kill this man...
- Stop.

61
00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:58,715
- Your Majesty.
- Is that really...

62
00:04:00,393 --> 00:04:01,943
the only reason?

63
00:04:02,347 --> 00:04:03,662
Did you kill innocent people...

64
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:05,896
and bring chaos into this world...

65
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:09,528
just because of that?

66
00:04:10,276 --> 00:04:11,325
I'm asking you.

67
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:16,327
Yes.

68
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:18,967
You are right, Lee Yin Jwa.

69
00:04:21,214 --> 00:04:22,263
You and I...

70
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:24,812
are not different.

71
00:04:26,105 --> 00:04:27,580
My only fault...

72
00:04:28,808 --> 00:04:31,041
is that I was born of a peasant.

73
00:04:33,027 --> 00:04:34,879
- Your Majesty.
- That is right.

74
00:04:35,847 --> 00:04:38,774
The person who knows how you feel
better than anyone else...

75
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:42,728
is the king you tried to...

76
00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:44,825
dethrone.

77
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:47,479
That's me.

78
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:49,586
However,

79
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:51,671
you are wrong.

80
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:54,578
That is not how...

81
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:57,037
you change the world.

82
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:58,632
There is another way.

83
00:05:01,707 --> 00:05:02,706
I am...

84
00:05:04,175 --> 00:05:05,231
determined...

85
00:05:08,605 --> 00:05:10,536
to prove that.

86
00:05:24,097 --> 00:05:28,698
(Episode 23: Long-standing Hope)

87
00:05:43,753 --> 00:05:45,065
You just wait.

88
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:46,707
I will kill you...

89
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:49,071
along with your other comrades.

90
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,996
- Keep a close eye on him.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:06:04,472 --> 00:06:05,432
Your Majesty.

92
00:06:05,886 --> 00:06:07,876
Have they not arrested
Prince Milpoong yet?

93
00:06:15,112 --> 00:06:16,356
He shouldn't have gone too far.

94
00:06:16,448 --> 00:06:19,546
Block all the ferry narrows
and search every corner!

95
00:06:19,548 --> 00:06:20,271
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

96
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:29,565
Stay here. I will find a way
to escape.

97
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:30,649
No.

98
00:06:31,816 --> 00:06:32,499
Why?

99
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:35,302
Why must I run away?

100
00:06:35,304 --> 00:06:37,502
- Prince Milpoong.
- I am the king.

101
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,222
I will go back to where I belong.

102
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,432
The king? Wake up.

103
00:06:52,363 --> 00:06:54,613
You were never worthy of that title.

104
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:57,812
It was not just the Patriarchs
and Lee Yin Jwa. I also...

105
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:00,396
used you.

106
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:02,986
You were pathetic and stupid.

107
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:05,637
Every time I praised you...

108
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,454
and said you deserve to be king,

109
00:07:07,456 --> 00:07:09,558
you were so easy to manipulate.

110
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:13,382
Yoon Yeong.

111
00:07:13,691 --> 00:07:16,392
Do you want to be taken advantage
of by people like me...

112
00:07:17,222 --> 00:07:18,940
and die in vain?

113
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:21,885
Are you going to be a clown
until the last moment...

114
00:07:21,887 --> 00:07:23,120
and end up dying?

115
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:44,231
How is the situation out there?
Where are the soldiers?

116
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,735
They are everywhere.

117
00:07:45,737 --> 00:07:47,378
Lee Yin Jwa's remaining forces...

118
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,067
were arrested too.

119
00:07:49,362 --> 00:07:50,335
What?

120
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:53,247
This will not do.

121
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:54,875
I brought you here...

122
00:07:54,877 --> 00:07:56,632
because Dal Moon asked me.

123
00:07:56,634 --> 00:07:58,008
But I can't do any more than this.

124
00:08:00,402 --> 00:08:02,433
Find me a boat
to the Qing Dynasty...

125
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:04,477
without telling Dal Moon.

126
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:07,038
But...

127
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:12,015
No. That is too dangerous.

128
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:15,185
This is half of my possession.

129
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,965
I will give you the rest...

130
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,112
if you find me a ship.

131
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:30,271
A king?

132
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,199
Wake up.

133
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:35,504
You were never worthy of that title.

134
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:38,724
It's not just the Patriarchs
Lee Yin Jwa. Even I...

135
00:08:39,276 --> 00:08:40,998
used you...

136
00:08:41,683 --> 00:08:43,458
because you were pathetic
and stupid.

137
00:08:44,745 --> 00:08:46,226
All I had to do was praise you
a little...

138
00:08:46,228 --> 00:08:48,310
and you were so easy to manipulate.

139
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,108
If you realized
that you weren't worth that much,

140
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:58,950
you shouldn't have
acted up like that.

141
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:03,835
No. No.

142
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,841
Don't give up on me.

143
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:06,803
Please.

144
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:09,105
I'll do anything you want.

145
00:09:09,105 --> 00:09:10,623
When I see people like you,

146
00:09:12,323 --> 00:09:13,845
I realize that social status
is a chimera.

147
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:16,259
You realize...

148
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:19,980
that most people are just animals...

149
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:21,860
who can talk.

150
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:26,121
Speaking of bloodlines,

151
00:09:27,058 --> 00:09:28,694
you are not even the son
of a king.

152
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:30,827
You're an indirect descent.

153
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:32,522
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,781
I'm sorry, Father.

155
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,325
How can I trust someone like you?

156
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:38,990
Who would think you're a prince?

157
00:09:53,784 --> 00:09:56,221
No. They are all wrong.

158
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:58,903
They are all wrong.

159
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:02,704
I am the true king of this kingdom.

160
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:07,423
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

161
00:10:07,425 --> 00:10:08,751
The entire kingdom...

162
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,719
will drive out the fake king...

163
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:13,182
and rise up...

164
00:10:13,184 --> 00:10:16,156
to welcome the real king.

165
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,298
This kingdom...

166
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:20,109
belongs to Prince Sohyeon...

167
00:10:20,972 --> 00:10:22,146
and my father.

168
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,053
My father...

169
00:10:57,956 --> 00:10:59,726
I came to meet His Majesty.
Announce my arrival.

170
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,462
Your Majesty,

171
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:05,213
are you really going
to give the order?

172
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:06,941
Do as I've told you.

173
00:11:06,943 --> 00:11:07,863
But Your Majesty...

174
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:12,144
Your Majesty, Inspector
Park Moon Soo of Saheonbu is here.

175
00:11:12,146 --> 00:11:13,017
Let him in.

176
00:11:18,956 --> 00:11:19,818
Come on in.

177
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:23,174
Your Majesty, where is
Prince Milpoong?

178
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:25,433
The Five Military Bases
are pursuing him now.

179
00:11:26,024 --> 00:11:27,683
He will never escape.

180
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:29,914
By the way Moon Soo,

181
00:11:30,675 --> 00:11:32,397
you should go back to Saheonbu.

182
00:11:33,245 --> 00:11:35,314
- Back to Saheonbu?
- Yes.

183
00:11:37,253 --> 00:11:38,609
In the palace...

184
00:11:39,527 --> 00:11:40,615
and Saheonbu,

185
00:11:42,113 --> 00:11:43,399
another long-standing war...

186
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:45,506
will begin.

187
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,619
Is anyone outside?

188
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:21,291
Did you call for me, Your Majesty?

189
00:12:22,581 --> 00:12:24,549
I'm summoning a meeting
at the Hall of Convenience now.

190
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:26,676
Tell all senior officials...

191
00:12:26,855 --> 00:12:28,097
that they must attend.

192
00:12:28,099 --> 00:12:29,624
Yes, Your Majesty.

193
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:40,041
Who are they?

194
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:42,438
Red robes mean
they are senior officials.

195
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,300
But I don't recognize them.

196
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,047
Isn't that Cho Duk Soo
from the Namin Party?

197
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:48,982
What? Namin Party?

198
00:12:48,984 --> 00:12:50,077
Namin Party?

199
00:12:57,003 --> 00:12:58,095
That's right.

200
00:12:58,217 --> 00:13:00,422
They're the Namins
who left the palace.

201
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:01,659
Exactly.

202
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:04,419
Why have they entered the palace?

203
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:18,862
His Majesty has arrived.

204
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:23,334
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

205
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,023
Your Majesty.

206
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:55,710
My apologies, but how could you...

207
00:13:56,393 --> 00:13:58,393
- bring these...
- If you're sorry,

208
00:14:00,144 --> 00:14:02,107
it's better to stop talking.

209
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:08,196
The topic for today's meeting...

210
00:14:08,855 --> 00:14:10,790
is what you want to ask.

211
00:14:11,303 --> 00:14:14,135
If you wait, I'll kindly...

212
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,709
give you the answers.

213
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:21,882
Thanks to your loyalty,

214
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,339
we could arrest
the rebellion leader Lee Yin Jwa...

215
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,474
and his remaining men.

216
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:27,727
This was possible...

217
00:14:28,463 --> 00:14:29,871
mainly because...

218
00:14:30,363 --> 00:14:32,261
of the people of this country...

219
00:14:32,531 --> 00:14:34,039
who gave up their lives...

220
00:14:34,735 --> 00:14:37,625
and all of you who committed
yourselves...

221
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:40,653
regardless of your
political background.

222
00:14:41,902 --> 00:14:43,120
I will...

223
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:46,074
never forget that.

224
00:14:47,284 --> 00:14:48,269
With that strength,

225
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,002
I will overcome the pain
caused by the revolt...

226
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:52,870
and lead this kingdom...

227
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,423
into a new Joseon...

228
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:57,310
without wavering.

229
00:14:58,175 --> 00:15:00,529
As the first step to that,

230
00:15:01,316 --> 00:15:04,312
I will reorganize the palace
by renewing personnel.

231
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,052
Chief Royal Secretary.

232
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:09,042
Read out my order.

233
00:15:09,044 --> 00:15:10,791
Yes, Your Majesty.

234
00:15:12,815 --> 00:15:17,815

235
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:21,038
Today,

236
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:24,015
I appoint new personnel.

237
00:15:24,597 --> 00:15:26,453
To take care of the confusion...

238
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:28,558
among the people by the revolt,

239
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:32,145
Cho Duk Soo,
former Hongmoongwan officer...

240
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:35,943
will be sent to Gyeongsang Province
as recruiting officer.

241
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:38,195
(Recruiting officer:
officer who recruits new soldiers)

242
00:15:40,368 --> 00:15:43,546
Inscrutable are the King's favors.

243
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,358
Also,

244
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:49,480
as Chungcheong Province's
recruiting officer,

245
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:51,791
the former vice minister Yoo Soon...

246
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,529
You can't do this.

247
00:15:53,531 --> 00:15:55,443
You can't do this, Your Majesty.

248
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:56,241
Your Majesty,

249
00:15:56,258 --> 00:15:58,509
what right do they have?

250
00:15:58,511 --> 00:15:59,791
Continue, chief royal secretary.

251
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

252
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:09,533
As Chungcheong Province's
recruiting officer,

253
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:11,469
the former vice minister...

254
00:16:11,612 --> 00:16:14,016
Yoo Soon will be appointed.

255
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,628
Inscrutable are the King's favors.

256
00:16:19,206 --> 00:16:21,766
And former minister
Yoon Heon Joong...

257
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:24,717
will be appointed
as dispatch officer.

258
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:27,409
(Dispatch Officer: inspects officers
and listens to complaints)

259
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:30,317
Inscrutable are the King's favors.

260
00:16:31,877 --> 00:16:34,795
Whatever your duty is,

261
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:37,611
show your loyalty in fulfilling it.

262
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:40,958
- Inscrutable are the King's favors.
- Inscrutable are the King's favors.

263
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:42,631
Cho Duk Soo?

264
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:44,603
Yoo Soon? Your Majesty.

265
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:46,604
They don't deserve...

266
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,865
to stand in this palace.

267
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:51,708
I can't accept this order.

268
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,383
What did they accomplish...

269
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:56,976
to take on such important duties?

270
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,305
Please hear our words.

271
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:02,261
- Please hear our words.
- Please hear our words.

272
00:17:02,263 --> 00:17:06,512
- Please hear our words.
- Please hear our words.

273
00:17:06,514 --> 00:17:08,053
They're the Namins.

274
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,090
Some of them might have...

275
00:17:10,104 --> 00:17:11,917
worked with Lee Yin Jwa.

276
00:17:11,963 --> 00:17:14,826
You should rather punish them.

277
00:17:14,828 --> 00:17:15,823
How could you appoint them?

278
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,745
This is ridiculous!

279
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:20,318
Work with Lee Yin Jwa?

280
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,282
Watch what you're saying!

281
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:24,183
He didn't say anything wrong.

282
00:17:24,183 --> 00:17:26,118
What nonsense are you saying?

283
00:17:40,389 --> 00:17:43,800
So? How are the senior officials
reacting?

284
00:17:44,674 --> 00:17:46,408
Both Patriarchs and Disciples...

285
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,118
are furious.

286
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,588
Appointing Namins would seem
preposterous to them.

287
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,100
The King seems to be starting
a difficult fight.

288
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,149
The whole palace...

289
00:17:59,151 --> 00:18:02,035
might become his enemy.

290
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,154
Your Majesty,

291
00:18:07,566 --> 00:18:09,608
how about taking
things a bit slowly?

292
00:18:10,113 --> 00:18:12,087
We just resolved the crisis...

293
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:14,259
and we have not arrested
Prince Milpoong yet.

294
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:15,706
There is still disorder...

295
00:18:15,706 --> 00:18:17,443
That is why we should carry on
with it now.

296
00:18:20,425 --> 00:18:21,886
The state of confusion...

297
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:25,118
is the right time to carry on
with the reform.

298
00:18:27,175 --> 00:18:28,389
What do you mean?

299
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,692
I am still a helplessly powerless
king.

300
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,900
The only thing I can rely on...

301
00:18:36,738 --> 00:18:37,707
is public opinion.

302
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:39,570
The revolt ended a few days ago...

303
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:41,784
and the officials are in a turf war.

304
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:43,407
What would the people think?

305
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:45,022
Public opinion...

306
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:45,956
(Lee Gwang Jwa, Minister of War,
Disciples)

307
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,523
Are you trying to gain power
by moving public opinion?

308
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,484
Thousands were killed in the revolt.

309
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:52,464
They are all families...

310
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:54,036
and relatives of the people.

311
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,094
This is the state we are in...

312
00:18:56,738 --> 00:18:58,338
and the officials are protesting...

313
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:00,309
when I suggested...

314
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,197
we appoint Namins.

315
00:19:04,991 --> 00:19:05,940
The fury...

316
00:19:07,402 --> 00:19:08,174
will certainly...

317
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:11,202
spread outside the palace.

318
00:19:21,136 --> 00:19:22,174
Court Lady Cheon.

319
00:19:25,904 --> 00:19:27,631
Court Lady Heo, how is His Majesty?

320
00:19:27,724 --> 00:19:29,361
May I see him for a moment?

321
00:19:29,361 --> 00:19:31,084
It will not be possible
at the moment.

322
00:19:31,091 --> 00:19:32,998
He has been in a meeting
all the while.

323
00:19:34,402 --> 00:19:35,285
You would know too.

324
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:38,159
The palace is in an uproar.

325
00:19:42,316 --> 00:19:44,768
The disciples defended the palace
during the revolt.

326
00:19:45,011 --> 00:19:45,797
Then,

327
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:48,020
how can he give the position
to Namins?

328
00:19:48,022 --> 00:19:49,930
The Patriarchs have an advantage
over us anyway.

329
00:19:50,053 --> 00:19:51,642
We cannot step back any further.

330
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:53,319
We Disciples...

331
00:19:54,347 --> 00:19:55,996
are losing the turf war.

332
00:19:56,823 --> 00:19:58,314
Is that what you want to protest?

333
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,119
My lord, that is not what
I am saying.

334
00:20:02,073 --> 00:20:04,666
Go on. What else...

335
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:06,863
do you want me to tell the King?

336
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,683
Is it true that you agreed to
appointing the Namins?

337
00:20:14,806 --> 00:20:16,159
That was the only way...

338
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:17,625
to quench the revolt.

339
00:20:17,627 --> 00:20:19,301
The King will demand us...

340
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,404
to hand over the next offices.

341
00:20:21,718 --> 00:20:23,008
How can the head of
the Patriarchs...

342
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,948
make such a compromise?

343
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:26,066
It was not compromise.

344
00:20:26,068 --> 00:20:27,811
(Min Jin Heon, Chairman of Congress,
Patriarchs)

345
00:20:27,813 --> 00:20:28,935
It was politics.

346
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:34,135
That was the better choice.

347
00:20:36,144 --> 00:20:37,821
I should not have done so...

348
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:39,907
as the head of Patriarchs.

349
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:43,969
I do not deserve to lead you any
longer.

350
00:20:44,855 --> 00:20:46,084
I will resign.

351
00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:48,933
Will that satisfy you?

352
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:50,045
My lord.

353
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,191
- My lord.
- My lord.

354
00:20:51,193 --> 00:20:52,602
- My lord.
- My lord.

355
00:20:53,775 --> 00:20:55,869
What are we to do?

356
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,046
Go and summon Chief Inspector
of Saheonbu.

357
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:01,263
- Right now, hurry.
- Yes, my lord.

358
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,738
We heard the news from the palace,
Chief Inspector.

359
00:21:06,738 --> 00:21:09,931
Gather all the officials
of Daejangcheong immediately.

360
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:11,268
Yes.

361
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,211
It will be Saheonbu.

362
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:18,575
Saheonbu will start moving first
since it has judicial power.

363
00:21:19,104 --> 00:21:20,447
Saganwon and Hongmoongwan...

364
00:21:20,924 --> 00:21:22,353
will give support.

365
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:26,409
The Patriarchs have controlled
the three agencies for that purpose.

366
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:29,562
I am preparing for that.

367
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,001
You are...

368
00:21:35,238 --> 00:21:36,874
in a difficult situation
because of me.

369
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:40,483
That is not true, Your Majesty.

370
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:44,361
I am rather...

371
00:21:45,363 --> 00:21:46,905
feeling relieved.

372
00:21:47,454 --> 00:21:49,221
You are the one in a difficult
situation.

373
00:21:51,487 --> 00:21:53,330
Fair appointment regardless of
political orientation...

374
00:21:54,573 --> 00:21:55,648
and equity.

375
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:01,016
That is a dream...

376
00:22:02,308 --> 00:22:03,860
I once dreamed of.

377
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:08,127
It is just that I realized...

378
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,514
that it is impossible in reality.

379
00:22:12,113 --> 00:22:13,315
It is impossible?

380
00:22:14,636 --> 00:22:17,022
You will find out soon.

381
00:22:18,183 --> 00:22:19,319
It is possible...

382
00:22:20,534 --> 00:22:22,559
to progress for a short moment.

383
00:22:24,183 --> 00:22:25,818
But politics reverts...

384
00:22:26,605 --> 00:22:28,306
to its original position.

385
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:32,703
So soon you will realize...

386
00:22:34,964 --> 00:22:36,964
that you had dreamed of...

387
00:22:40,636 --> 00:22:41,971
an unattainable dream.

388
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:50,861
Wait.

389
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,331
Wait a moment.

390
00:23:03,705 --> 00:23:05,806
We can progress for a short
moment...

391
00:23:07,863 --> 00:23:09,499
but will fall back eventually?

392
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:11,849
Then why...

393
00:23:15,175 --> 00:23:16,965
did you help me?

394
00:23:17,932 --> 00:23:19,302
If you think...

395
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:21,748
it will be of no use?

396
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:24,132
Why?

397
00:23:33,473 --> 00:23:34,577
That is...

398
00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:39,398
The reason is that...

399
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:02,709
Min Jin Heon.

400
00:24:07,636 --> 00:24:09,019
The man who entrusted Yoon Yeong...

401
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:10,718
did not come for the money?

402
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:12,193
Not yet.

403
00:24:13,128 --> 00:24:15,825
He is a greedy man
and that is why I volunteered.

404
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:18,409
- But for some reason...
- Can we get in touch with him?

405
00:24:19,566 --> 00:24:22,861
He is an itinerant merchant
who does not have an address.

406
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:24,478
Then we do not know where he lives?

407
00:24:46,441 --> 00:24:47,780
We will find a boat soon.

408
00:24:47,782 --> 00:24:49,229
Then we will go to Qing and...

409
00:24:57,214 --> 00:24:59,109
You deserted me too.

410
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:01,448
Did you not?

411
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,340
I was easy to take advantage of
because I was dumb and pathetic?

412
00:25:08,714 --> 00:25:09,694
That is nonsense.

413
00:25:10,691 --> 00:25:13,687
Did you really think I would not
know how other people thought of me?

414
00:25:14,956 --> 00:25:16,940
Everyone laughed at me
and mocked me from behind.

415
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,051
They treated me like
an insect.

416
00:25:20,222 --> 00:25:22,173
But in case I became king,

417
00:25:22,796 --> 00:25:23,883
they flattered me...

418
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:25,827
in front of me. Am I wrong?

419
00:25:27,644 --> 00:25:28,967
But it did not matter.

420
00:25:29,901 --> 00:25:31,422
I could just become king.

421
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,140
When I became the king,

422
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,450
they would not laugh at me
even from behind.

423
00:25:36,816 --> 00:25:37,699
And you...

424
00:25:41,784 --> 00:25:44,204
would hold me sincerely.

425
00:25:51,542 --> 00:25:53,849
I am sorry.

426
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:00,590
The one who made you like this...

427
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:03,435
is me.

428
00:26:06,597 --> 00:26:08,999
So give me a chance too.

429
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:13,095
So I can forgive at least
one person...

430
00:26:14,784 --> 00:26:16,051
just like I was...

431
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,545
forgiven by someone.

432
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,561
Tomorrow at Hall of Convenience,

433
00:26:30,612 --> 00:26:32,532
the senior officials will probably
not show up.

434
00:26:33,062 --> 00:26:33,844
If that happens,

435
00:26:34,682 --> 00:26:36,218
I will issue the order.

436
00:26:37,175 --> 00:26:38,893
I will do as you say.

437
00:26:42,112 --> 00:26:44,000
Thank you for your decision,
Chief Justice.

438
00:26:44,995 --> 00:26:45,980
From tomorrow,

439
00:26:46,691 --> 00:26:48,239
it will be war again.

440
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:50,832
Why do you not get some sleep?

441
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,450
- No, I have things to...
- It is because...

442
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,145
I am tired.

443
00:27:00,816 --> 00:27:01,877
Oh, I am sorry.

444
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,691
I did not think of that.

445
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:05,141
You are working your old subject...

446
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,604
too harshly.

447
00:27:23,552 --> 00:27:27,235
Excuse me. May I see Court Lady Heo
for a moment?

448
00:27:30,253 --> 00:27:31,140
Yeo Ji.

449
00:27:33,761 --> 00:27:36,640
Why are you at the palace
at this hour?

450
00:27:43,472 --> 00:27:44,397
Really?

451
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,122
You made these snacks just for me?

452
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,415
You seemed to be working late,

453
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,996
so I was going to give it
to Court Lady Heo.

454
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:56,059
Then open it. Let's take a look.

455
00:27:56,061 --> 00:27:57,265
No, Your Majesty.

456
00:27:57,267 --> 00:27:58,782
- I will just...
- Why?

457
00:27:58,997 --> 00:28:00,425
You said it's for me.

458
00:28:00,425 --> 00:28:02,510
But I'm shy.

459
00:28:09,818 --> 00:28:10,768
Did you...

460
00:28:12,503 --> 00:28:14,736
Did you really make this yourself?

461
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:18,904
Do they look weird?

462
00:28:19,204 --> 00:28:21,597
It was my first time
so the shapes are...

463
00:28:21,597 --> 00:28:22,511
No.

464
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:24,156
I thought...

465
00:28:25,722 --> 00:28:27,301
you were just a tomboy,

466
00:28:27,964 --> 00:28:29,065
but this is impressive.

467
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:32,056
Do you mean that, Your Majesty?

468
00:28:33,394 --> 00:28:35,452
Are they okay?

469
00:28:35,725 --> 00:28:37,559
Not just okay.

470
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:39,968
This is...

471
00:28:54,323 --> 00:28:55,836
What is it, Your Majesty?

472
00:28:58,284 --> 00:29:00,800
No... Well...

473
00:29:04,003 --> 00:29:06,170
Are you choking?

474
00:29:06,501 --> 00:29:08,222
Should I get you some water?

475
00:29:08,222 --> 00:29:09,278
No, it is okay.

476
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:12,428
It is bearable.

477
00:29:15,028 --> 00:29:17,025
It is bearable?

478
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:20,238
Goodness, does it taste that bad?

479
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:21,935
Goodness, Your Majesty.

480
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:24,356
Yeo Ji,

481
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:26,077
did you not say...

482
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:29,620
you got thoroughly prepared
before coming into the palace?

483
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,840
Well, yes. I tried my best...

484
00:29:31,842 --> 00:29:33,513
You said your cooking skills...

485
00:29:34,362 --> 00:29:35,741
are much better...

486
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:39,144
than the court ladies
in the royal kitchen.

487
00:29:39,735 --> 00:29:41,455
That is what I thought.

488
00:29:42,987 --> 00:29:44,472
That is what you thought?

489
00:29:45,738 --> 00:29:47,205
I am so sorry, Your Majesty.

490
00:29:47,207 --> 00:29:49,669
I will never do this again.

491
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:04,740
Yes.

492
00:30:06,425 --> 00:30:07,880
This is what I liked...

493
00:30:10,714 --> 00:30:12,232
when I was with you.

494
00:30:15,363 --> 00:30:16,181
Pardon?

495
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:19,823
Do you remember...

496
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:22,101
the day...

497
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,816
when I taught you...

498
00:30:25,636 --> 00:30:28,226
what it really means
to become a court lady?

499
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:32,157
I will tell you...

500
00:30:33,355 --> 00:30:34,873
what it means to be a court maid.

501
00:30:35,995 --> 00:30:39,343
That means something like
this can happen.

502
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,244
And this.

503
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:51,219
What you did to me that night...

504
00:30:54,081 --> 00:30:55,543
Is it what I think it is?

505
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:00,072
You were trying to start
a fight with me.

506
00:31:01,222 --> 00:31:02,688
Am I correct?

507
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:09,331
But you were wrong.

508
00:31:14,886 --> 00:31:16,047
I was not...

509
00:31:17,222 --> 00:31:19,132
trying to start a fight with you.

510
00:31:52,323 --> 00:31:53,309
This is...

511
00:32:03,816 --> 00:32:04,799
what I wanted to do.

512
00:32:10,113 --> 00:32:11,070
And...

513
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,601
this.

514
00:32:35,355 --> 00:32:36,846
And I wanted...

515
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,932
to always...

516
00:32:43,902 --> 00:32:45,478
keep you by my side like this.

517
00:33:50,311 --> 00:33:52,874
(Episode 46 will air shortly.)

518
00:33:53,694 --> 00:33:54,428
Step aside!

519
00:33:54,428 --> 00:33:56,506
Aren't they Saheonbu's soldiers?

520
00:33:56,545 --> 00:33:57,780
What's going on?

521
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,898
- What's happening?
- Is it really happening?

522
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:01,741
- What was that?
- Oh no.

523
00:34:01,741 --> 00:34:03,243
What's going on?

524
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,590
This is the house of rebel Lee
Yin Jwa's father-in-law.

525
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:11,842
Letters or goods,

526
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:13,223
find anything...

527
00:34:13,811 --> 00:34:15,045
to prove his guilt!

528
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:16,136
- Yes, master!
- Yes, master!

529
00:34:18,928 --> 00:34:20,014
What are you doing?

530
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:23,405
His Majesty promised that there will
be no guilt by association.

531
00:34:23,405 --> 00:34:25,405
How could you be innocent,

532
00:34:25,655 --> 00:34:27,514
when your son-in-law was a rebel?

533
00:34:27,788 --> 00:34:29,202
Capture the offender!

534
00:34:29,202 --> 00:34:30,313
- Yes, master!
- Yes, master!

535
00:34:35,623 --> 00:34:36,879
What did you just say?

536
00:34:37,584 --> 00:34:39,908
Saheonbu seized Lee Yin Jwa's
father-in-law?

537
00:34:40,209 --> 00:34:42,354
I made clear that there will be
no guilt by association.

538
00:34:43,295 --> 00:34:44,448
Your Majesty.

539
00:34:44,702 --> 00:34:46,897
The Chief Corrector and Professors
have arrived.

540
00:34:46,897 --> 00:34:47,781
Your Majesty.

541
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,325
Let them enter!

542
00:34:56,764 --> 00:34:57,609
Your Majesty.

543
00:34:57,611 --> 00:34:58,517
(Chief Corrector:
head of Saganwon)

544
00:34:58,542 --> 00:34:59,611
(Chief Professor:
head of Hongmoongwan)

545
00:34:59,655 --> 00:35:01,411
I know what you're about to say.

546
00:35:01,811 --> 00:35:03,065
Should I still...

547
00:35:03,453 --> 00:35:05,239
listen to you?

548
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:16,803
What's the current situation?

549
00:35:25,053 --> 00:35:26,181
Chief Justice.

550
00:35:32,873 --> 00:35:36,232
Execute the next order by the King.

551
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:37,279
Yes, master.

552
00:35:40,077 --> 00:35:42,538
(Saheonbu)

553
00:35:52,178 --> 00:35:53,366
- Master.
- Master.

554
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:54,608
Did you hear?

555
00:35:54,608 --> 00:35:56,506
- Saheonbu...
- Where's Chief Inspector?

556
00:35:56,819 --> 00:35:58,296
Where are they?

557
00:35:59,897 --> 00:36:04,284
Start interrogation on Lee Yin Jwa's
father-in-law and his family.

558
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:07,288
Judicial law belongs to
the authority of Saheonbu.

559
00:36:07,288 --> 00:36:10,454
Regardless of the King's order,
we will do...

560
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:15,445
Regardless of the King's order?

561
00:36:18,717 --> 00:36:21,319
This is revolt and high treason.

562
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:22,525
What are you doing?

563
00:36:23,023 --> 00:36:24,038
Me?

564
00:36:24,952 --> 00:36:27,745
As an inspector of Saheonbu,
I'm doing my job.

565
00:36:28,108 --> 00:36:29,922
I'm merely convicting the sinners...

566
00:36:31,186 --> 00:36:33,284
going against the King's order.

567
00:36:38,482 --> 00:36:41,147
They're getting rid of
Inspector Park from the office?

568
00:36:41,147 --> 00:36:43,545
I'm still in touch
with high officials.

569
00:36:43,545 --> 00:36:45,764
Jipyeong got furious
and told me to...

570
00:36:45,764 --> 00:36:47,764
call the other soldiers.

571
00:36:47,766 --> 00:36:49,155
- What?
- But...

572
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,705
it didn't sound right.
So I came here.

573
00:36:54,522 --> 00:36:56,798
Inspection Leader,
we should do something.

574
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,097
Let's go!

575
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:00,086
We should be on Inspector
Park's side!

576
00:37:05,233 --> 00:37:06,572
What should I do?

577
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:09,795
I'm not really the outgoing one.

578
00:37:11,092 --> 00:37:12,973
Why did I even tell him that?

579
00:37:13,288 --> 00:37:16,873
I must have gotten attached
to him recently.

580
00:37:20,686 --> 00:37:22,350
Is Saheonbu on the move?

581
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,855
It'll start soon.

582
00:37:23,967 --> 00:37:26,988
What can they do
even with the King's order?

583
00:37:27,381 --> 00:37:29,882
The kingdom's executive agency
is doing its work.

584
00:37:29,952 --> 00:37:32,123
The court must be empty.

585
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:34,850
Let them do the work
with just Namins.

586
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,382
It won't last long.

587
00:37:36,475 --> 00:37:38,177
Promoting regardless of the clan?

588
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,934
No King ever won this fight.

589
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,159
No one ever succeeded.

590
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,689
Minister! Minister of Personnel!

591
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,413
What is it?

592
00:37:47,413 --> 00:37:49,413
The King is totally acting up!

593
00:37:49,415 --> 00:37:51,207
He's starting the fight!

594
00:37:51,366 --> 00:37:53,571
What do you mean?
What's going on?

595
00:37:54,491 --> 00:37:56,032
My apologies, Your Majesty.

596
00:37:56,373 --> 00:37:58,744
You're appointing me
as a prime minister?

597
00:37:59,053 --> 00:38:01,536
Like I said,
you'll be the prime minister,

598
00:38:02,272 --> 00:38:03,723
and Jo Hyeon Myeong...

599
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:05,759
will be assigned as Chief Inspector.

600
00:38:06,905 --> 00:38:07,914
Your Majesty!

601
00:38:09,264 --> 00:38:11,401
No, Your Majesty.
You can't!

602
00:38:11,607 --> 00:38:13,288
How could you assign...

603
00:38:13,326 --> 00:38:16,280
such heavy responsibility on us?

604
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,180
I can't accept this either!

605
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:22,662
Then are you leaving me alone
on this road?

606
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:27,131
Is that it? Are you telling me
to do it by myself?

607
00:38:30,702 --> 00:38:34,073
You know what I'm about to do.

608
00:38:34,905 --> 00:38:38,725
Equity which this nation
never had.

609
00:38:42,514 --> 00:38:43,724
This is...

610
00:38:45,381 --> 00:38:46,561
more like a favor,

611
00:38:47,287 --> 00:38:48,962
not a King's order.

612
00:38:50,163 --> 00:38:52,111
I'm asking you...

613
00:38:53,327 --> 00:38:54,557
to walk...

614
00:38:57,967 --> 00:38:59,635
through this harsh road
with me.

615
00:39:09,084 --> 00:39:10,178
(Wi Byeong Joo (Namin))

616
00:39:10,178 --> 00:39:11,561
- Did you hear?
- Huh?

617
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:13,738
The court is hiring Namins,
causing chaos.

618
00:39:22,795 --> 00:39:23,867
Excuse me.

619
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:25,961
Hey.

620
00:39:27,077 --> 00:39:28,389
Can I ask something?

621
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:29,767
Soldiers say,

622
00:39:30,288 --> 00:39:32,854
the King appointed Namins,
making chaos in the court.

623
00:39:33,233 --> 00:39:34,155
Is that true?

624
00:39:34,193 --> 00:39:37,378
It's none of your business.

625
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:38,562
Stay quiet.

626
00:39:38,936 --> 00:39:39,980
Tell me.

627
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:44,029
Are Namins really getting a place
in the court?

628
00:39:49,702 --> 00:39:50,899
So this is the story.

629
00:39:51,327 --> 00:39:54,054
To stabilize the nation,
His Majesty...

630
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:57,165
is supporting appointment
of Namins.

631
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:58,045
- Oh.
- Hmm...

632
00:39:58,045 --> 00:40:01,308
But look what statesmen are doing.

633
00:40:01,678 --> 00:40:03,163
Both the Disciples and Patriarchs
are disobeying...

634
00:40:03,163 --> 00:40:07,413
the King's order
to keep their seats.

635
00:40:08,233 --> 00:40:11,038
They've never fought in the war!

636
00:40:11,038 --> 00:40:12,380
Those filthy ones!

637
00:40:12,382 --> 00:40:14,439
Get down! I need to speak up!

638
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,320
I...

639
00:40:16,756 --> 00:40:20,030
lost my eldest son during a war.

640
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:23,065
They've never held a sword,

641
00:40:23,067 --> 00:40:26,126
and how dare could they
act like that?

642
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:27,983
- That's right!
- He's right!

643
00:40:28,155 --> 00:40:31,467
Oh, I'm the storyteller.

644
00:40:31,467 --> 00:40:33,467
Wait, I also need to talk!

645
00:40:33,928 --> 00:40:37,122
How long are they going to
keep arguing?

646
00:40:37,124 --> 00:40:40,756
This is why only the civilians
get distressed!

647
00:40:40,795 --> 00:40:42,920
- Yes!
- He's right!

648
00:40:42,928 --> 00:40:44,186
He said it right!

649
00:40:44,186 --> 00:40:46,897
He spoke the truth!

650
00:40:46,897 --> 00:40:49,036
- Didn't he?
- He did.

651
00:40:49,038 --> 00:40:50,241
I...

652
00:40:50,241 --> 00:40:52,241
I have something to say too!

653
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:54,319
- Oh man.
- Listen to me carefully.

654
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,286
He's doing great.

655
00:40:55,506 --> 00:40:56,437
Awesome.

656
00:40:56,592 --> 00:40:57,647
You're better than me.

657
00:40:57,649 --> 00:40:58,576
Oh goodness.

658
00:41:00,272 --> 00:41:01,964
That's what they're saying?

659
00:41:02,061 --> 00:41:03,230
You should have seen it.

660
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:05,486
I had no place to talk.

661
00:41:05,686 --> 00:41:08,034
They've endured for too long.

662
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:12,111
They've watched a long boring
fight between the clans.

663
00:41:12,288 --> 00:41:15,674
This time, the public will
become one for sure.

664
00:41:17,162 --> 00:41:18,921
I'll message this to the palace.

665
00:41:19,272 --> 00:41:20,100
Right away.

666
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,208
Yes, master.

667
00:41:21,342 --> 00:41:22,739
Brother! Brother!

668
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,738
I found it!

669
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:27,464
Where that guy lives!

670
00:41:30,077 --> 00:41:31,191
This way.

671
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:36,400
Brother.

672
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,573
This is the place.

673
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:44,404
Bok Dan!

674
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:52,358
Prince. We need to go now.

675
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,194
What are you doing?

676
00:41:57,194 --> 00:41:58,250
You want to get caught?

677
00:41:59,038 --> 00:42:01,296
Hurry, Prince.

678
00:42:08,803 --> 00:42:09,850
No way.

679
00:42:11,998 --> 00:42:13,066
Prince Milpoong?

680
00:42:29,163 --> 00:42:30,156
What is it?

681
00:42:31,686 --> 00:42:32,900
Can...

682
00:42:34,162 --> 00:42:37,079
you pay the rest now?

683
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:40,393
- What?
- We're almost there.

684
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:41,957
The boat is ready.

685
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,819
You can go by yourself...

686
00:42:43,819 --> 00:42:45,821
This isn't what we agreed on.

687
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:47,592
What are you doing?

688
00:42:47,592 --> 00:42:49,584
What?

689
00:42:49,584 --> 00:42:52,128
You've been glimpsing sideways.

690
00:42:52,311 --> 00:42:54,061
Is a boat really there?

691
00:42:54,063 --> 00:42:55,538
Are you fooling us?

692
00:42:55,538 --> 00:42:57,170
Hey!

693
00:42:59,779 --> 00:43:02,045
You're just a rebel!
Give me,

694
00:43:02,334 --> 00:43:03,475
give me the money!

695
00:43:03,475 --> 00:43:04,668
How dare you!

696
00:43:05,084 --> 00:43:07,671
How dare you...

697
00:43:34,584 --> 00:43:35,807
Yoon Yeong.

698
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:37,666
Are you okay?

699
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:45,761
Is anyone there?

700
00:43:46,545 --> 00:43:48,706
Anyone?

701
00:43:49,491 --> 00:43:51,607
Is anyone there?

702
00:43:51,678 --> 00:43:52,796
No.

703
00:43:53,311 --> 00:43:56,054
Don't make a sound.

704
00:43:57,569 --> 00:43:58,825
Yoon Yeong.

705
00:44:07,202 --> 00:44:08,226
Yoon Yeong.

706
00:44:12,967 --> 00:44:14,154
It's there!

707
00:44:14,561 --> 00:44:15,476
There!

708
00:44:15,827 --> 00:44:17,311
The rebels I reported,

709
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,236
they're over there!

710
00:44:21,866 --> 00:44:22,958
Yoon Yeong.

711
00:44:23,467 --> 00:44:24,717
Get up.

712
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,991
You should go with me.

713
00:44:27,397 --> 00:44:29,617
You should be with me.

714
00:44:40,084 --> 00:44:41,883
You still said...

715
00:44:43,116 --> 00:44:45,116
you'd make me your queen,

716
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,403
when I'm just a prostitute.

717
00:44:50,834 --> 00:44:52,095
But I...

718
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,259
I never...

719
00:44:56,116 --> 00:44:58,755
really loved you.

720
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:00,922
I'm sorry.

721
00:45:01,873 --> 00:45:03,387
No, no.

722
00:45:03,561 --> 00:45:04,715
No.

723
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:07,945
I'm sorry, Yoon Yeong.

724
00:45:08,569 --> 00:45:10,569
Please don't do this to me.

725
00:45:14,506 --> 00:45:16,837
I'll be there first.

726
00:45:18,045 --> 00:45:20,045
Don't be scared.

727
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:23,015
I'll be waiting...

728
00:45:24,381 --> 00:45:25,881
as your queen...

729
00:45:26,514 --> 00:45:28,194
in another world.

730
00:45:29,397 --> 00:45:30,592
So you...

731
00:45:31,709 --> 00:45:34,065
should be the King...

732
00:45:35,889 --> 00:45:38,208
the King...

733
00:45:52,022 --> 00:45:53,046
No!

734
00:45:56,983 --> 00:46:00,344
Don't leave me, Yoon Yeong.

735
00:46:05,131 --> 00:46:07,949
You shouldn't leave me!

736
00:46:09,631 --> 00:46:12,199
You can't!

737
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:20,842
Over there!

738
00:46:20,842 --> 00:46:23,441
Prince Milpoong should be
over there!

739
00:46:33,913 --> 00:46:36,694
She's here! Here's the rebel.

740
00:46:41,483 --> 00:46:42,725
Prince Milpoong isn't here.

741
00:46:42,725 --> 00:46:43,827
Find him!

742
00:46:43,827 --> 00:46:44,809
- Yes!
- Yes!

743
00:46:57,428 --> 00:46:58,624
Bok Dan.

745
00:47:13,444 --> 00:47:15,131
But I still...

746
00:47:17,561 --> 00:47:18,717
can't...

747
00:47:19,959 --> 00:47:23,012
let her die.

748
00:47:42,936 --> 00:47:44,035
Bok Dan.

749
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:50,931
I'm Bok Dan.

750
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,816
What's your name?

751
00:47:58,553 --> 00:47:59,704
Dal...

752
00:48:03,288 --> 00:48:04,414
Dal Moon.

753
00:48:13,866 --> 00:48:14,899
Is anyone...

754
00:48:48,311 --> 00:48:49,555
Wake up.

755
00:49:02,334 --> 00:49:04,621
What are you doing here?

756
00:49:06,741 --> 00:49:07,822
Huh?

757
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:13,143
You...

758
00:49:16,936 --> 00:49:18,159
didn't...

759
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:27,238
live so harshly for this.

760
00:49:34,483 --> 00:49:35,894
I didn't let you go...

761
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,100
for this.

762
00:50:00,889 --> 00:50:03,269
No!

763
00:50:11,694 --> 00:50:12,714
Bok Dan...

764
00:50:37,342 --> 00:50:38,868
So she...

765
00:50:40,577 --> 00:50:42,162
died.

766
00:50:45,694 --> 00:50:49,090
Dal Moon took care of the dead body.

767
00:50:53,131 --> 00:50:54,285
Dal Moon...

768
00:50:55,537 --> 00:50:58,388
They're looking for Prince Milpoong.

769
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,524
So,

770
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:03,213
My apologies, Your Majesty.

771
00:51:03,288 --> 00:51:06,066
We have an urgent message
from Saheonbu.

772
00:51:11,022 --> 00:51:13,022
How rude you are!

773
00:51:24,866 --> 00:51:26,866
I said step aside.

774
00:51:26,868 --> 00:51:28,266
No, we won't.

775
00:51:29,698 --> 00:51:31,357
The officials of Saheonbu...

776
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:34,025
reject the new Chief Inspector.

777
00:51:34,663 --> 00:51:38,042
We can't accept the new
Chief Inspector.

778
00:51:38,983 --> 00:51:40,240
We won't step aside,

779
00:51:40,717 --> 00:51:42,597
even if we risk our lives.

780
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,317
So you'll disobey the King's order?

781
00:51:50,514 --> 00:51:52,046
At last, they're...

782
00:51:52,483 --> 00:51:53,703
What are you doing?

783
00:51:53,748 --> 00:51:55,162
Call the soldiers and...

784
00:51:55,164 --> 00:51:56,313
No, you can't.

785
00:51:58,288 --> 00:51:59,928
You shouldn't make a scene here.

786
00:51:59,928 --> 00:52:01,928
- Master.
- Think what they'd want.

787
00:52:02,413 --> 00:52:05,248
The pretext that His Majesty is
persecuting Saheonbu.

788
00:52:05,248 --> 00:52:07,248
But we can't just watch.

789
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,123
They're holding back
on Chief Inspector.

790
00:52:09,123 --> 00:52:10,304
You should.

791
00:52:10,306 --> 00:52:13,205
He's enduring this indignity too.

792
00:52:23,436 --> 00:52:24,642
Stop.

793
00:53:31,295 --> 00:53:32,860
Officials of Saheonbu...

794
00:53:33,928 --> 00:53:35,928
are blocking Chief Inspector?

795
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:38,560
My apologies, Your Majesty.

796
00:53:42,522 --> 00:53:45,739
Then why did you still help me?

797
00:53:46,905 --> 00:53:48,078
When you thought...

798
00:53:48,717 --> 00:53:50,637
it'd be useless?

799
00:53:51,842 --> 00:53:53,082
Why?

800
00:53:55,975 --> 00:53:57,352
It's...

801
00:54:00,842 --> 00:54:03,049
it's because...

802
00:54:07,256 --> 00:54:08,810
that's real...

803
00:54:08,998 --> 00:54:10,639
politics.

804
00:54:12,998 --> 00:54:14,662
Moving forward might be a second.

805
00:54:15,413 --> 00:54:17,695
Even if one falls back,

806
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,874
to move forward...

807
00:54:21,733 --> 00:54:23,377
unwearyingly...

808
00:54:24,733 --> 00:54:27,730
with no disappointment.

809
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:30,789
With that,

810
00:54:31,592 --> 00:54:32,997
this nation...

811
00:54:33,944 --> 00:54:35,120
will change...

812
00:54:39,233 --> 00:54:41,811
bit by bit.

813
00:54:48,053 --> 00:54:49,153
We'll move forward.

814
00:54:55,248 --> 00:54:56,505
Unwearyingly...

815
00:54:58,553 --> 00:54:59,968
without disappointment.

816
00:55:02,842 --> 00:55:04,359
Even if...

817
00:55:07,077 --> 00:55:09,385
we have to fall back.

818
00:55:26,186 --> 00:55:28,077
His Majesty will arrive.

819
00:55:28,077 --> 00:55:30,721
All soldiers should escort him
with perfection.

820
00:55:30,811 --> 00:55:31,879
- Yes!
- Yes!

821
00:55:41,502 --> 00:55:45,048
The King has arrived.

822
00:55:45,335 --> 00:55:47,064
It's His Majesty!

823
00:56:03,398 --> 00:56:04,658
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

824
00:56:08,338 --> 00:56:09,628
Officials of Saheonbu...

825
00:56:09,845 --> 00:56:13,116
will have to open a meeting
right away.

826
00:56:13,118 --> 00:56:14,572
(Cabinet meeting:
meeting of Saheonbu)

827
00:56:14,572 --> 00:56:15,939
I will...

828
00:56:17,095 --> 00:56:18,386
speak...

829
00:56:19,775 --> 00:56:21,035
by myself.

830
00:56:24,697 --> 00:56:27,948
The King has arrived!

831
00:56:29,416 --> 00:56:33,100
The King has arrived!

832
00:56:35,205 --> 00:56:37,362
The King...

833
00:56:37,775 --> 00:56:40,058
has arrived!

834
00:56:42,361 --> 00:56:43,913
I'm here!

835
00:56:44,994 --> 00:56:47,426
The King...

836
00:56:48,009 --> 00:56:50,444
has arrived!

837
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:04,435
Yes.

838
00:57:06,713 --> 00:57:08,265
I'm the King.

839
00:57:11,525 --> 00:57:12,702
I...

840
00:57:13,892 --> 00:57:15,511
I am...

841
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:18,894
the King!

842
00:57:22,017 --> 00:57:23,086
(Cabinet meeting)

843
00:57:23,088 --> 00:57:24,266
I'm here...

844
00:57:26,556 --> 00:57:29,063
by myself...

845
00:57:31,439 --> 00:57:32,655
to announce...

846
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,335
that a new Joseon...

847
00:57:35,853 --> 00:57:37,530
should commence...

848
00:57:38,525 --> 00:57:39,950
from Saheonbu.

849
00:57:46,134 --> 00:57:48,863
Among the agencies,
Saheonbu was especially...

850
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:51,470
ill with corruption.

851
00:57:53,384 --> 00:57:56,240
Who would ever trust in Saheonbu,

852
00:57:57,322 --> 00:58:00,323
and acclaim its impartiality.

853
00:58:05,213 --> 00:58:06,838
Your Majesty, my apologies but...

854
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:07,808
Stop!

855
00:58:08,931 --> 00:58:10,931
I'm not done yet!

856
00:58:17,111 --> 00:58:18,332
But I...

857
00:58:20,283 --> 00:58:21,811
will no longer...

858
00:58:22,431 --> 00:58:24,314
overlook the old illness.

859
00:58:24,548 --> 00:58:26,810
It's for this nation...

860
00:58:27,939 --> 00:58:30,007
and all the Saheonbu officials.

861
00:58:30,556 --> 00:58:32,970
Today, I announce...

862
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:36,641
to dismiss Head of Personnel,

863
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:39,814
who was in charge of
the appointment.

864
00:58:40,251 --> 00:58:41,550
And I declare that...

865
00:58:42,556 --> 00:58:44,054
there will be a reform...

866
00:58:44,634 --> 00:58:46,075
on its...

867
00:58:47,666 --> 00:58:49,291
whole system!

868
00:59:12,478 --> 00:59:14,267
(Haechi)

869
00:59:24,697 --> 00:59:27,775
Execute the punishment
on the sinners.

870
00:59:27,775 --> 00:59:28,908
I'm innocent.

871
00:59:28,908 --> 00:59:30,314
I'll walk by myself.

872
00:59:30,314 --> 00:59:31,838
When the whole public stands
for the King,

873
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:33,338
what excuse do you have?

874
00:59:33,338 --> 00:59:34,892
I'll keep my word...

875
00:59:34,892 --> 00:59:36,619
to punish you.

876
00:59:36,619 --> 00:59:38,088
A life without regret...

877
00:59:38,088 --> 00:59:40,201
may be scarier than anything else.

878
00:59:40,203 --> 00:59:41,877
You can't kill me.

879
00:59:41,877 --> 00:59:43,298
Lee Geum!

880
00:59:43,298 --> 00:59:44,694
- Your Majesty!
- I'm the King.
